2. **Hospital Bed Availability**: No real-time integration despite obvious need
3. **Weather Integration**: Critical for HEMS, absent in all solutions
4. **OBD-II/Telematics**: Vehicle diagnostics not integrated anywhere
5. **Traffic Data**: Real-time traffic routing not implemented
6. **FAA Compliance**: HEMS-specific aviation features severely lacking
7. **AI-Powered Features**: No vendors using AI for documentation assistance, clinical decision support, or predictive dispatch
8. **Patient Lookup**: Limited HIE (Health Information Exchange) integration

### Emerging Opportunities:
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Most vendors are desktop-first with mobile adapters
2. **Consumer-Grade UX**: EMS software lags 5-10 years behind consumer apps
3. **Interoperability**: Limited cross-platform data sharing

## CONCLUSION

The EMS MDT market is mature but ripe for disruption. Incumbent vendors (ZOLL, ESO, ImageTrend) dominate through integration and relationships, not innovation. Key opportunities exist in:

1. **User Experience**: Current solutions are functional but not delightful
2. **Voice/AI**: Massive gap in hands-free, intelligent documentation
3. **Real-Time Data**: Hospital integration, traffic, weather absent
4. **Mobile-First**: Most vendors adapted desktop software vs. building mobile-native
5. **Interoperability**: Cross-platform data sharing still challenging
6. **Specialization**: HEMS and IFT markets underserved

A new entrant with modern technology, consumer-grade UX, AI-powered intelligence, and aggressive pricing could capture significant market share, particularly in the private ambulance and air medical segments where incumbent solutions are weakest.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Voice-first interface
- AI documentation assistant
- Seamless offline mode
- Universal CAD/billing integration
- Tablet-optimized (not adapted)
- Disruptive pricing
- Focus on crew experience (not just dispatch)
